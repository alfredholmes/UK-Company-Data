The script get_migrations.py pulls company migration data from the
companies house api

To run you need enter a companies house api key into an array in a
python file called apikeys.py

The CompanyNumbers2012-2018.csv file contains a collated list of
companies from the companies house snapshots from years 2012,
2013, 2014, 2016, 2017 (2015 is missing) available on the web
archive - see ../sources.txt for more details

postcode_la.csv is a slimmed down postcode file available from ONS (see
../sources.txt) with only the postcode and local authority id

The script get_migrations.py writes to a csv after every 100 companies
the data for each move - the data contains the company id, from
postcode, to postcode, from LA, to LA, company incorporation date and 
number of filings at the time of moving
